## What is EJB?


## What are the different types of EJBs?
   There are three types of EJBs in JEE:
   a) **Session Beans**: They represent business logic and are further classified into stateful and stateless session beans.
   b) **Entity Beans** (Deprecated in EJB 3.0): They represent persistent data stored in a database.
   c) **Message-Driven Beans**: They are used to process asynchronous messages in a messaging system.

## What is the purpose of a session bean?
   Session beans encapsulate the business logic of an application. They provide services to clients, such as executing business methods, managing transactions, and maintaining conversational state (in the case of stateful session beans).

## How are stateful and stateless session beans different?
   **Stateful session beans** maintain conversational state with clients across multiple method invocations. Each client is associated with a specific instance of the stateful session bean. 
   In contrast, **stateless session beans** do not maintain any conversational state. They are stateless and can serve multiple clients concurrently.

## What is the purpose of an entity bean?
   **Entity beans** (deprecated in EJB 3.0) represent persistent data stored in a database. They provide an object-oriented view of the data and encapsulate the operations related to the data, such as creation, retrieval, update, and deletion (CRUD).

## What is a message-driven bean (MDB)?
   **Message-driven beans** are used to process asynchronous messages in a Java Message Service (JMS) system. They act as message consumers and are triggered when a message arrives at a specified destination.

## What is the role of the EJB container?
   The EJB container provides a runtime environment for executing EJB components. It manages their lifecycle, transactions, security, concurrency, and other services. The container is responsible for instantiating, pooling, and managing EJB instances, as well as handling the communication between clients and EJB components.

## What are the different transaction attributes in EJB?
   EJB supports different transaction attributes, such as:
   - **Required**: Specifies that the method must run within a transaction. If a transaction already exists, it joins it; otherwise, a new transaction is started.
   - **RequiresNew**: Specifies that the method must run within a new transaction. If a transaction already exists, it is suspended until the method completes.
   - **Mandatory**: Specifies that the method must run within a transaction. If no transaction exists, an exception is thrown.

## How does dependency injection work in EJB?
   **Dependency injection** in EJB allows the container to inject necessary resources and dependencies into an EJB, such as data sources, session beans, or other EJBs. This reduces coupling and allows for more modular and maintainable code. EJBs can use annotations like `@EJB` or `@Resource` to declare and inject dependencies.
   
## How can you handle exceptions in EJB?
   In EJB, you can handle exceptions using the **standard Java exception handling mechanism**. EJBs can throw application-specific exceptions or use system-defined exceptions like **javax.ejb.EJBException**. You can catch and handle exceptions within the EJB methods or let them propagate to the calling client, where they can be caught and processed.
   
## What is the purpose of the `@Stateless` annotation in EJB?
The `@Stateless` annotation is used to declare a session bean as stateless in EJB. Statelessness means that the session bean does not maintain any conversational state with clients between method invocations. Each method call on a stateless session bean is independent of previous calls.

## What is the purpose of the `@TransactionAttribute` annotation in EJB?
The `@TransactionAttribute` annotation is used to specify the transaction attribute for a method in an EJB. It allows you to define how the method should participate in transactions. For example, you can specify whether a method requires a transaction (`TransactionAttributeType.REQUIRED`) or should run without a transaction (`TransactionAttributeType.NOT_SUPPORTED`).

## How can you implement asynchronous processing in EJB?
Asynchronous processing can be implemented in EJB using message-driven beans (MDBs). MDBs allow you to consume messages asynchronously from a message queue or topic. By annotating an MDB class with `@MessageDriven`, you can define the message listener and specify the destination from which the messages should be consumed.

## What is the purpose of the `@Singleton` annotation in EJB?
   The `@Singleton` annotation is used to declare a session bean as a singleton in EJB. Singleton session beans are designed to have only one instance shared by multiple clients. They are commonly used for managing application-wide resources or maintaining global state.

## How can you pass data between EJBs?
Data can be passed between EJBs using method parameters and return values. You can define method signatures in EJB interfaces that accept and return data objects. Additionally, EJBs can use dependency injection (`@EJB`) to obtain references to other EJBs and invoke their methods, passing data as method arguments.

## Can you explain the lifecycle of a stateful session bean?
The lifecycle of a stateful session bean in EJB involves the following phases:

1. **Creation**: The container creates an instance of the stateful session bean when a client requests it.
2. **Method Invocation**: The client interacts with the stateful session bean by invoking its methods, passing data and performing operations.
3. **Passivation**: If the bean is not actively being used, the container can choose to passivate (serialize) the bean's state and remove it from memory to conserve resources.
4. **Activation**: When the client needs to access the bean again, the container activates (deserializes) the bean's state and makes it available for invocation.
5. **Removal**: The client or the container can choose to remove the bean, causing its instance to be destroyed and releasing associated resources.

## How can you handle concurrency in EJB?
EJB provides built-in mechanisms to handle concurrency, ensuring thread safety and preventing concurrent access issues. By default, stateless session beans and message-driven beans are designed to be concurrent, allowing multiple clients to access them simultaneously. For stateful session beans, you can configure concurrency using annotations like `@ConcurrencyManagement` and `@Lock` to specify locking strategies and access modes.


## MVC in JEE
MVC (Model-View-Controller) is an architectural pattern commonly used in JEE (Java Enterprise Edition) applications to separate concerns and improve maintainability. Here's a short explanation of MVC in JEE:

- **Model**: The Model represents the application's data and business logic. It encapsulates the application's state and provides methods for interacting with and manipulating the data. In JEE, the Model can be implemented using Enterprise JavaBeans (EJBs), entity classes, or other data access mechanisms.

- **View**: The View represents the presentation layer of the application. It is responsible for rendering the user interface and displaying the data to the user. In JEE, the View can be implemented using JavaServer Faces (JSF) pages, JSP (JavaServer Pages), or HTML/CSS templates.

- **Controller**: The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It receives user input from the View and invokes the appropriate methods on the Model to update the data. It also handles the navigation flow and determines which View should be displayed based on the user's actions. In JEE, the Controller can be implemented using servlets, managed beans, or other request handling components.

The MVC pattern promotes a separation of concerns, where the Model focuses on the data and business logic, the View focuses on the presentation, and the Controller handles the interaction between the two. This separation allows for easier maintenance, testing, and reusability of the components.

## Containers in JEE
1. **EJB Container**:
   The EJB container manages the execution of EJB components, which are server-side components that encapsulate business logic. The EJB container provides services such as transaction management, security, concurrency, and resource pooling. It handles the lifecycle of EJBs, including instantiation, pooling, activation, passivation, and removal. The EJB container also ensures that EJBs adhere to the EJB specification and provides mechanisms for dependency injection and remote method invocation.

2. **Web Container**:
   The web container, also known as the servlet container, manages the execution of web components, such as servlets and JavaServer Pages (JSP). It provides services for handling HTTP requests and responses, managing sessions, URL mapping, security, and concurrency. The web container handles the lifecycle of web components, including instantiation, initialization, invocation, and destruction. It ensures that web components comply with the servlet and JSP specifications, and it interfaces with the web server to handle web-based communication.

Both containers are part of the larger JEE application server, which provides a complete runtime environment for deploying and running enterprise applications. The application server includes additional services such as database connectivity, messaging, naming and directory services, and management and monitoring capabilities. It manages the deployment and configuration of application components and provides a scalable and reliable infrastructure for running JEE applications.

## JSF

JSF (JavaServer Faces) is a component-based web framework that is part of the JEE (Java Enterprise Edition) platform. It is designed to simplify the development of user interfaces for web applications by providing a set of reusable UI components and a robust event-driven programming model. Here's an overview of JSF in JEE:

1. **Component-Based Architecture**:
   JSF follows a component-based architecture, where the user interface is constructed using reusable UI components. These components can be declaratively defined in JSF pages using markup tags or programmatically created. JSF provides a rich set of built-in components for common UI elements like input fields, buttons, tables, and panels. Additionally, developers can create custom components to suit specific application requirements.

2. **Event-Driven Programming Model**:
   JSF uses an event-driven programming model, where user interactions trigger events that are processed by JSF's event handling mechanism. JSF supports various types of events, such as action events, value change events, and validation events. Developers can define event listeners and event handling methods to respond to user actions and update the application's state.

3. **Managed Bean**:
   JSF relies on managed beans to store and manage the application's data and behavior. A managed bean is a Java object managed by the JSF framework. Developers can define managed beans either programmatically or using annotations. Managed beans act as a bridge between the UI components and the underlying business logic, allowing for data manipulation and processing.

4. **Navigation and Page Flow**:
   JSF provides features for managing navigation and page flow within the application. Developers can define navigation rules that specify the outcome of an action or event and the corresponding destination page. JSF handles the navigation and page rendering based on these rules, allowing for seamless user interaction and page transitions.

5. **Backing Integration**:
   JSF integrates well with other JEE technologies and frameworks. It can seamlessly work with Java EE containers, allowing for the integration of EJBs (Enterprise JavaBeans) and other Java EE components. JSF also supports integration with popular frameworks like CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection) and JPA (Java Persistence API), enabling the development of robust and scalable enterprise applications.
