# Architecture Pattern


## What is difference between Architectural pattern and Design pattern?
- Architecture define the overall **structure** and **organization** of a software system. They provide high-level **guidelines** and **principles** for **designing** the system's **components**, their **relationships**, and the flow of data or control between them. 
  - Examples of architectural patterns include the Model-View-Controller (MVC), Microservices, Layered Architecture, and Event-Driven Architecture.
- Design patterns represent a way to structure classes to solve common problems
## Can you explain the Model-View-Controller (MVC)
The Model represents the data and business logic, View represents the presentation layer, The controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View.
