## Can you explain what Git is and how it's used in software development?
Git is a version control system that enables developers to keep track of changes they make to their code, share code, and undo changes if necessary,
## Can you explain the difference between Git and SVN?
- SVN is a centralized version control system, with a single repository that all developers access
- Git is a distributed version control system, that is faster and more flexible than SVN,
## Can you explain the difference between a merge and rebase, and when would you use either?
- **merge** combines changes from different branches into one,
- **rebase** applies changes from one branch to another
merges are best for **combining changes**, while rebases keep things in a **straight line**
