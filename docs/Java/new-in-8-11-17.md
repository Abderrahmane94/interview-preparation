# New in 8, 11 & 17

## What's new in java 8

1. **Lambda Expressions**: Lambda expressions allow the representation of anonymous functions and enable functional programming in Java. They provide a concise syntax for writing inline functions, improving code readability and enabling the use of functional interfaces.

2. **Stream API**: The Stream API provides a fluent and functional way to process collections of data. Streams allow for efficient sequential or parallel processing of data using functional operations such as map, filter, reduce, and more. It simplifies the code for data manipulation and enables better performance optimizations.

3. **Default Methods**: Default methods, also known as defender methods or virtual extension methods, allow the addition of methods to interfaces without breaking existing implementations. Default methods provide a way to add new functionality to interfaces while maintaining backward compatibility.

4. **Optional**: The Optional class introduced in Java 8 provides a container object that may or may not contain a non-null value. It encourages better handling of null values and helps avoid NullPointerExceptions by explicitly indicating the presence or absence of a value.

5. **Date and Time API**: Java 8 introduced a new Date and Time API in the java.time package. It provides improved date and time handling, addressing various issues with the legacy java.util.Date and java.util.Calendar classes. The new API offers better immutability, thread-safety, and support for time zones.

6. **Method References**: Method references provide a shorthand syntax for referring to methods or constructors. They simplify the code when passing methods as arguments or when implementing functional interfaces.

7. **Default Functional Interfaces**: Java 8 introduced several functional interfaces in the java.util.function package, such as Predicate, Function, Consumer, and Supplier. These interfaces facilitate the use of lambda expressions and provide a standard way to represent common functional patterns.

8. **CompletableFuture**: The CompletableFuture class provides a powerful framework for asynchronous programming. It supports composing, combining, and chaining asynchronous tasks, allowing developers to write non-blocking, efficient, and responsive code.

## What's new in Java 11

1. **Local Variable Syntax for Lambda Parameters**: Java 11 extended the var keyword to allow its use as a parameter in lambda expressions. This enables more concise lambda expressions by inferring the parameter type.

2. **HTTP Client API (Standard)**: Java 11 introduced a new built-in HTTP client API in the `java.net.http` package. It provides a more modern and efficient way to send HTTP requests and handle responses, replacing the old `HttpURLConnection` API.

3. **Epsilon**: Epsilon is a new experimental garbage collector introduced in Java 11. It is intended for use in scenarios where the application doesn't require memory management, effectively providing a no-op garbage collector. It can be useful for performance testing or extremely short-lived applications.

4. **Launch Single-File Source-Code Programs**: Java 11 introduced a new feature that allows running Java source code files directly with the java command, without the need for explicit compilation. This simplifies the execution of small, single-file Java programs.

5. **ZGC (Experimental)**: ZGC is a scalable and low-latency garbage collector introduced as an experimental feature in Java 11. It aims to provide consistent pause times regardless of heap size, making it suitable for large heaps in applications requiring high-performance and low-latency.

6. **Flight Recorder**: Flight Recorder, previously a commercial feature, was made available as part of OpenJDK in Java 11. It is a profiling and diagnostics tool that collects low-level runtime information about the Java application, enabling performance analysis and troubleshooting.

7. **Unicode 10 Support**: Java 11 added support for Unicode 10. This includes updated character sets, scripts, and properties defined in Unicode 10.0.0.

8. **Deprecation of Java EE and Corba Modules**: In Java 11, the Java EE and CORBA modules were deprecated and removed from the default classpath. These technologies are now part of the Jakarta EE platform and can be used through separate libraries.

9. **Removal of JavaFX**: JavaFX was removed from the Java SE platform starting from Java 11. It is now developed and maintained as a separate project outside of the JDK.

These are some of the notable features and changes introduced in Java 11. Java 11 is a Long-Term Support (LTS) release, meaning it will receive updates and support for an extended period of time.
