# Java OOP
# <TOCInline toc={toc} />

## What is OOP?
It is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects, which are instances of classes.

## What is polymorphism in Java?
Polymorphism in Java refers to the ability of an object to take on multiple forms. This can be achieved through method overloading or method overriding.

## Key concepts of OOP in Java

- **Encapsulation**: Objects encapsulate data (attributes) and behavior (methods) together, hiding the internal details and providing a clean interface for interaction with other objects.

- **Inheritance**: Objects can inherit properties and behaviors from parent classes, forming class hierarchies. Inheritance promotes code reuse and the creation of specialized classes.

- **Polymorphism**: Objects of different classes can be treated uniformly through a common interface, allowing for dynamic and flexible behavior. Polymorphism enables objects to take on multiple forms and respond differently to the same method call.

- **Abstraction**: Abstraction allows for the creation of abstract classes and interfaces that define common characteristics and behaviors without specifying implementation details. It focuses on essential features and hides unnecessary complexity.

- **Modularity**: OOP promotes modular design, allowing the system to be divided into smaller, independent units (objects and classes). Modularity improves code organization, reusability, and maintainability.

## What is the difference between method overloading and method overriding in Java?
Method overloading refers to the process of defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters, whereas method overriding refers to the process of defining a method in a subclass that has the same signature as a method in the superclass.
