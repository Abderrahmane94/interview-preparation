# <TOCInline toc={toc} />

## What is java generics?
Java generics is a feature introduced in Java 5 that allows for the creation of generic classes, interfaces, and methods. It provides a way to define classes and methods that can work with different types, while maintaining type safety at compile time.
## What is exception handling in Java?
Exception handling in Java refers to the process of detecting and responding to exceptional circumstances that occur during program execution. This is typically achieved using try-catch blocks.
## What is the difference between a checked exception and an unchecked exception in Java?
A checked exception is a type of exception that must be declared in a method's signature or handled using a try-catch block( handle at compile time), whereas an unchecked exception is a type of exception that does not need to be declared or handled( handle at runtime).
