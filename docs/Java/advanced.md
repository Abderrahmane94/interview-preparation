## What is the difference between java vs java enterprise edition?
**Java** and **Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE)**, now known as **Jakarta EE**, are different versions of the Java programming language and platform. Here's an overview of the differences between Java and Java EE:
1. **Java**:
    - Java Standard Edition (Java SE) is the core version of Java that provides the basic language features and libraries.
    - It is suitable for developing general-purpose applications, desktop applications, command-line tools, and standalone applications.
    - Java SE includes core APIs for handling data types, input/output operations, networking, multithreading, and more.
    - It provides the foundation for other Java platforms, including Java EE.

2. **Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) / Jakarta EE**:
    - Java EE, now known as Jakarta EE, is an extension of Java SE specifically tailored for building enterprise-level applications.
    - It provides additional libraries, frameworks, and specifications to simplify the development of scalable, secure, and distributed applications.
    - Jakarta EE includes features such as web services, Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB), Java Persistence API (JPA), Java Message Service (JMS), servlets, JavaServer Pages (JSP), and more.
    - It focuses on server-side development and is designed for building large-scale, transactional, and mission-critical applications.
    - Jakarta EE also supports advanced enterprise features like clustering, load balancing, and fault tolerance.

In summary, **Java SE** is the base version of Java, providing the **core language** and **libraries**, while **Java EE** (Jakarta EE) extends Java SE with **additional features and specifications** specifically for building **enterprise-level applications**.
