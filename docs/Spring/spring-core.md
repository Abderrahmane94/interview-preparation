# Spring Core

## What is the Spring framework?	
The Spring framework is a popular open-source application framework for Java-based enterprise applications. It provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model for developing robust and scalable applications.
## What are core features of spring?	
Ioc, DI, AOP, Spring MVC, Security, transaction management.
## What is application context in spring?	
the central container that holds and manages the configuration, instantiation, and lifecycle of application components, such as beans and their dependencies
## What is dependency injection in spring?	
Spring container “injects” objects into other objects or “dependencies”.
## Advantages of DI	
Decoupling, Testability, Reusability, Flexibility
## Name the different bean scopes used by Spring. And the default scope?	
singleton (default), prototype, for the web: request, session, global-session, application, and websocket
## What is AOP?	
Programming paradigm that enables modularizing cross-cutting concerns (e.g., logging, security, transaction management) by separating them from the core business logic. 
## What is IoC?
is a fundamental concept and core feature. Spring IoC container, also known as the Spring container or application context, is responsible for implementing IoC and managing the dependencies of Spring-based applications.
## What is the use of Profiles in spring boot?
Keep the separate configuration of environments.
## What is Spring Actuator? What are its advantages?
Actuators provide below pre-defined endpoints to monitor our application (Health, Info, Beans, Mappings, Configprops, Httptrace, Heapdump, Threaddump, and Shutdown).
## Can you explain the difference between Spring and JEE?
- Spring is a lightweight and flexible framework that can be used with different application servers and provides many features and modules.
- JEE is a complete set of specifications and technologies for building enterprise applications, but can be more complex and requires a compliant application server.
