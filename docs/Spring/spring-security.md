# Spring Security

## what's spring security?
Spring Security is a powerful framework that provides authentication, authorization, and other security features for Java applications. It is widely used to secure web applications, REST APIs, and microservices.
## how to implement spring security using jwt?
1. Configure JWT Dependencies: Add the required dependencies for JWT support, such as the `spring-security-jwt` library.

2. JWT Token Provider: Implement a JWT token provider class that generates JWTs, signs them with a secret key, and includes necessary claims like the user ID, roles, or other custom attributes.

3. Authentication Filter: Create a custom authentication filter that intercepts the login request, validates the credentials, and issues a JWT token upon successful authentication. This filter should be responsible for generating and setting the JWT in the response headers or body.

4. Authorization Filter: Implement an authorization filter that intercepts incoming requests, extracts the JWT token, and validates its authenticity and validity. This filter should perform the necessary checks, such as verifying the signature, expiration, and potentially additional custom validation logic.

5. Spring Security Configuration: Configure Spring Security to use the custom authentication and authorization filters, as well as specify the security rules and access permissions.

6. Controller and Resource Protection: Annotate your controllers or REST endpoints with appropriate security annotations, such as `@PreAuthorize`, to enforce authorization rules based on roles or custom conditions. These annotations can be used to protect specific resources or methods.
