# Spring Data

## Can you explain what JPA is and how it differs from JDBC?	
- **JDBC** is a low-level API that provides a set of classes and interfaces for connecting to relational databases and executing SQL queries.
- **JPA** is a higher-level API that abstracts the database access and provides an object-relational mapping (ORM) framework. 
## Can you explain the concept of transaction management and how it is implemented in Spring?
## Can you explain the difference between the various JPA fetch types?
## Can you explain the different inheritance strategies in JPA?
- Single Table Inheritance (default) 
- Joined Table Inheritance 
- Table Per Class Inheritance 
- Mapped Superclass Inheritance

## Explain the Lazy loading used by JPA
Lazy fetching means that associated entities are loaded only when explicitly accessed or requested by the application.
