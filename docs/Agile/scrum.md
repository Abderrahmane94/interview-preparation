## How does Agile methodology help teams to manage risk?	
Agile methodology helps teams to manage risk by breaking down a project into smaller, more manageable pieces and by continuously testing and validating assumptions throughout the development process.
## What is a User Story in Agile methodology?	
A User Story is a brief, high-level **description** of a product feature or requirement from the perspective of an end user. User Stories are used to guide development efforts and to ensure that the team remains focused on delivering value to the customer.
## What are the key principles of Agile methodology?	
The key principles of Agile methodology include **prioritizing customer satisfaction**, **embracing change**, **delivering working software frequently**, promoting **collaboration and communication**, and maintaining a focus on **simplicity**.
## How do you measure the success of an Agile project?	
Success in Agile projects is typically measured by the **amount of value delivered to the customer**, the **speed** at which that value is delivered, and the team's ability to continuously **improve** and adapt to **changing** requirements.
## What is the difference between Agile and Waterfall methodologies?	
The main difference between Agile and Waterfall methodologies is that Agile is an **iterative** and **incremental** approach that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction, while Waterfall is a **linear** and **sequential** approach that emphasizes planning, documentation, and control.
## What is a Product Backlog in Agile methodology?	
A Product Backlog is a **prioritized list of features** or requirements for a product that is maintained by the Product Owner. The Product Backlog guides the development efforts of the Agile team and is constantly refined and reprioritized based on feedback and changing requirements.
## What is a Sprint Review in Agile methodology?	
A Sprint Review is a **meeting** held at the **end** of each Sprint during which the Agile team **demonstrates** the work that was completed during the Sprint and receives **feedback** from **stakeholders**. The Sprint Review helps to ensure that the team is delivering value to the customer and that the product is meeting its goals.
## What is a Retrospective in Agile methodology?	
A Retrospective is a **meeting** held at the **end** of each Sprint during which the Agile team **reflects** on their performance and identifies areas for **improvement**. The Retrospective helps to promote continuous improvement and to ensure that the team is always striving to work more effectively and efficiently.
## What is the role of the Product Owner in Agile methodology?	
The Product Owner is responsible for **defining and prioritizing the features** and requirements for a product and for ensuring that the team is delivering value to the customer. The Product Owner works closely with stakeholders to gather feedback and to ensure that the product is meeting its goals.
## What is the role of the Development Team in Agile methodology?	
The Development Team is responsible for **designing, developing, and testing the product increment** during each Sprint. The Development Team is self-organizing and cross-functional, meaning that they have all of the skills and knowledge necessary to deliver the product increment.
## What is a Burndown Chart in Agile methodology?	
A Burndown Chart is a **visual representation** of the **amount** of work remaining in a Sprint or in the overall project. The Burndown Chart helps the Agile team to track progress and to identify potential issues that may impact the project's ability to deliver value to the customer.
## What is Continuous Integration in Agile methodology?	
Continuous Integration is a practice in which **code changes** are **merged** into a central repository and **tested** automatically on a regular basis. Continuous Integration helps to ensure that the code is always in a working state and that issues are identified and addressed quickly.
## What is the difference between a Release and a Sprint in Agile methodology?	
A Release is a **larger**, more significant **milestone** in the development of a product, while a Sprint is a **time-boxed period** during which a specific increment of the product is delivered. Releases typically encompass multiple Sprints and may involve more significant changes to the product.
## What is the purpose of a Daily Standup in Agile methodology?	
The purpose of a Daily Standup is to provide a brief **status update** to the **team** on progress since the last meeting, discuss any impediments or issues, and identify what needs to be accomplished before the next meeting. The Daily Standup helps to ensure that the team remains aligned and focused on achieving the goals of the Sprint.
## What is a Sprint Goal in Agile methodology?	
A Sprint Goal is a concise statement that describes the objective of the Sprint and the value that the team intends to deliver to the customer. The Sprint Goal helps to ensure that the team remains focused and aligned on the goals of the Sprint.
## What is a Velocity in Agile methodology?	
Velocity is a **measure** of the amount of work that an Agile team can complete during a Sprint. Velocity is calculated by summing the estimates for all of the completed user stories or product backlog items during the Sprint. Velocity can be used to help the team plan and forecast future Sprints.
## what's kanban?
Kanban is a project management methodology that originated in the manufacturing industry and has since been widely adopted in the IT sector. It provides a visual way to manage workflows and improve productivity and efficiency.

In Kanban, work items are represented as cards or sticky notes, which are moved through various stages of a workflow on a Kanban board. The board typically consists of columns that represent different stages of work, such as "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done." 
## What's waterfall?
Waterfall is a traditional project management methodology that is widely used in the IT sector, particularly for large-scale software development projects. It follows a linear sequential approach, where each phase of the project is completed before moving on to the next one. The name "waterfall" is derived from the idea that the project flows steadily downwards, like a waterfall.

The waterfall methodology typically consists of the following sequential phases:

1. **Requirements gathering**: In this phase, the project team works closely with stakeholders to gather and document all the project requirements. This involves understanding the desired features, functionality, and specifications of the software or system to be developed.

2. **System design**: Once the requirements are finalized, the system design phase begins. It involves creating detailed technical specifications and architectural designs for the software or system. This phase establishes the overall structure and components of the solution.

3. **Implementation**: The implementation phase involves coding and development based on the design specifications. Developers write the actual code, build the software, and integrate various components to create the desired system.

4. **Testing**: After the implementation phase, thorough testing is conducted to ensure that the software or system functions correctly and meets the specified requirements. Testing can include unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing.

5. **Deployment**: Once testing is complete and the software is deemed ready, it is deployed to the production environment or delivered to the client. This phase involves installing the software, configuring it, and making it available for end-users.

6. **Maintenance and support**: After deployment, the maintenance and support phase begins. It involves ongoing maintenance, bug fixes, updates, and providing technical support to users as needed.

The waterfall methodology emphasizes a structured and sequential approach, where each phase must be completed before moving on to the next one. It is often used in projects with well-defined requirements and where changes are expected to be minimal once development begins.

However, one of the main drawbacks of the waterfall methodology is its lack of flexibility. It assumes that all requirements can be defined upfront and that changes can be easily accommodated. In practice, it is often challenging to gather all requirements accurately at the beginning of a project, leading to potential delays or rework if changes are needed later.

Many modern project management approaches, such as Agile and iterative methodologies, have emerged as alternatives to the waterfall model, offering more flexibility and adaptability to changing requirements and customer needs.
