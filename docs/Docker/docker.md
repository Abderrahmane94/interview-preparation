## What is Docker?
Docker is an open-source **platform** that allows you to **automate** the **deployment**, **scaling**, and **management** of applications using **containerization**. 
## What is a Container?
**Containerization** is a lightweight approach to **virtualization** that enables you to **package** an application and its dependencies into a standardized unit called a container.
**Containers** provide **isolation**, **portability**, and **reproducibility**, making it easier to **deploy** and **run** applications consistently across different environments.

## What is the difference between Docker & a virtuel machine?
Docker and a virtual machine (VM) are both technologies used for **running applications**, but they differ in their approach and architecture:

1. **Docker**:
    - Docker is a **containerization platform** that allows applications to be **packaged** and **run** in isolated containers.
    - It uses the **host operating system's kernel** and **shares system resources**, such as CPU, memory, and disk, with the host and other containers.
    - Docker containers are **lightweight**, **fast to start and stop**, and have less overhead compared to VMs.
    - Containers are **portable** and can run consistently across **different environments**, making application deployment and scalability easier.
    - Docker focuses on packaging the application and its dependencies into a **single container**, providing an efficient and consistent runtime environment.

2. **Virtual Machine (VM)**:
    - A VM is a software **emulation of a physical computer**, running an operating system and applications.
    - VMs create a virtualized environment, isolating the guest operating system and applications from the host system.
    - Each VM requires its **own complete operating system**, which results in larger resource usage and **slower startup** times compared to containers.
    - VMs provide stronger **isolation** between **applications** and the **host system**, making them suitable for running different operating systems simultaneously.
    - VMs are often used for running legacy applications, running multiple applications with different dependencies, or providing a sandboxed environment.

In summary, **Docker** uses **containerization** to provide **lightweight** and **portable** application execution, while **virtual machines** emulate complete **operating systems** with **stronger isolation** but have **higher resource overhead**. The **choice** between Docker and VMs depends on the **specific use case**, **resource requirements**, and **isolation** needs of the applications being deployed.
