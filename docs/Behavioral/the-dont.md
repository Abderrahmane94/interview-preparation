# The Don'ts

- Never be negative about your current/previous employer or colleagues.

- Don't ask, "What do I need to do in this role?" Be prepared. If it is still not clear what is expected, then ask the question, "What do my daily
tasks look like?"

- Don't ask: "What do you do as a company?" Be prepared. If it is still not clear what is expected, ask the question, "What can you tell me
about new products or growth plans?"

- Never start talking about salary yourself during the application! Discuss this with your consultant, he knows about it.

- Don't tell about yourself with keywords without providing context. For example: 'I am a creative jack-of-all-trades', 'I am results-oriented',
'I am an all-rounder'. If you say something like that, give a concrete example that shows it

- Never be desperate for the job. Don't say I need this job, this is important to me or I need the money. Be enthusiastic and positive, but not
desperate.

- Never say, "Someone recommended me" or "The recruiter told me to go here." This comes across as if you have no intrinsic motivation.

- Never say, "I've never heard of you" or "I don't know your product" or "I've never heard of the platform". Even if this is true, saying it
explicitly is not an advantage. Ask if they can tell you a little more about the company.

- It's not a bad thing if your answer is sometimes long but be careful that it doesn't become an endless incoherent story.
