Good morning / afternoon

Thank you for giving me the opportunity to introduce myself.

My name is **Abderrahmane Sardaoui**, I'm a Java Full-stack Developer with more than 6 years of proven experience in the IT sector and Development.

I’m **passionate about technology**,

I’m **solution-oriented**,

I am a **team player** and I like to **collaborate with others**.

I have extensive expertise in developing web applications using **Spring and Java EE frameworks**. I also have experience in database design and development using **Postgres and hibernate**.

As a developer, I am well-versed in using **Git and svn**, a distributed version control system that enables efficient collaboration and code management. Additionally, I have experience working with **Angular**, a popular front-end framework that allows developers to create dynamic and responsive web applications.

I have also worked in an Agile environment using the **Scrum methodology**, which emphasizes teamwork, communication, and iterative development. This approach has enabled me to deliver high-quality products in a timely and efficient manner.

Furthermore, I am an advocate for **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**, a development approach that emphasizes writing automated tests before writing production code.
